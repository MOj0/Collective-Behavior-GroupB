\begin{abstract}
The collective behaviors observed in nature, such as flocking, herding, or schooling, often serve as adaptive strategies that enhance the survival chances of individuals within a group.
Understanding these natural behaviors serves as inspiration for designing autonomous agents capable of sophisticated interactions within a simulated environment.
Our goal is to simulate prey and predator with different predator tactics (attack center, attack nearest, attack isolated, attacks from various directions, constant bearing hunting), escape maneuvers (split, hourglass, herd, vacuole, flash expansion, fountain) and parameters (perception radius, moving speed, turning speed) in order to conclude how different escape maneuvers affect predator's success.

\section*{Introduction}

% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.
\dropcap{O}ne of the most striking patterns in biology is the formation of animal aggregations.
Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources \cite{complexity_pattern}.
We would like to experimentally determine which flocking behaviors help the prey best defend itself against a predator.

The flocking behavior can be simulated in different ways.
For example, Heppner and Grenader \cite{Heppner_nonlinear_model} were modeling birds behavior with stochastic nonlinear differential equations.
Oweis, Ganesan, and Cheok \cite{centralized_flocking} took a different approach and modeled birds with a centralized logic (as in the server-client architecture).
In 1987, Reynolds \cite{reynolds1987flocks} proposed a simple algorithm, which was groundbreaking at the time, to model the
flocking behavior of birds, herding of sheep, and similar phenomena, known as the Boids (Bird-oid objects) model.
In contrast to controlling the interactions of the entire flock, the Boids simulation focuses on
dictating the behavior of each individual boid. Despite consisting of a few simple rules, this
algorithm produces complex and lifelike behaviors similar to those observed in nature.

Our research is based on a paper by Papadopoulou and others \cite{papadopoulou2022emergence}, which we will extend with the results of our predator and prey simulation.
Although we are not using fuzzy logic to set the direction and speed of our boids, which makes the movement less natural, we have taken some elements for our model from
\cite{JDemsar_predator_attacks}. Specifically, we've set the field of vision for our boids to 300° and implemented occlusion for the predator.

\section*{Methods}
The Boids model is the foundation of our flocking model. Every object in such a model adheres to the three simple
rules as shown in Figure \ref{fig:boids}.

\subsection*{Boids model implementation overview}

Each boid $B$ possesses three basic properties: position, velocity, and acceleration. Behavioral attributes include perception radius ($r_P$), separation radius ($r_S$), and perception angle ($fov$). The Euclidean distance, given by $d(p, q)^2 = (p_1-q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2$, is utilized for distance computations.

The simulation loop updates boid directions based on three rules: \textbf{collision avoidance} (or \textbf{separation}), \textbf{alignment}, and \textbf{cohesion}. The avoidance direction is determined by summing the vector differences between the boid $B$ and its neighbors $B_i$ when their distance is within $r_S$. The cohesion direction is obtained by averaging the vector differences between the positions of boid $B$ and its neighbors $B_i$. The alignment direction is computed as the average velocity of neighboring boids $B_i$, subtracted from the velocity of the boid $B$, considering neighbors within a perception radius $r_P$.

The neighbors (all $B_i$) of a boid $B$ are determined using distance and angle conditions:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:neighbor_predicate}
    d(B, B_i)^2 < {r_P}^2 \, \land \, \text{AngleBetween}(B, B_i) \leq fov
\end{equation}
Modifying the base Boids model with the \textbf{field of vision} is an improvement inspired by \cite{JDemsar_predator_attacks}.

Additionally inspired by \cite{JDemsar_predator_attacks} is \textbf{occlusion}.
This effectively disregards boids that remain hidden from the view of a specific boid, as closer
boids obstruct their visibility (see Figure \ref{fig:occlusion}). Given a list of potential neighboring boids,
we must determine which are occluded and in turn take only the nearest (non-occluded) boids as neighbours. 
This is done by iterating through the list of neighboring boids of boid $B$ and computing the angle between all
neighbor pairs $(B_i, B_j)$. If the angle is below a threshold, boids $B_i$ and $B_j$ are considered occluded.
Then we just have to determine which neighbor is closer (which one blocks the other). This is done by computing
the minimum distance: $min(d(B, B_i), d(B, B_j))$. It is worth noting that we have only added occlusion
checks to the predator in our model.

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6] % Adjust the scale as needed

		\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (boid5) at (1,1.5) {};
    \end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Neighbors (blue) of the observed boid (green). Occluded boid is marked gray.}
	\label{fig:occlusion}
\end{figure}

In order to add even more realism, the \textbf{turn speed} of a boid is limited.
Whenever the acceleration of a boid is computed, the angle between the acceleration vector and the current heading vector is checked.
If it exceeds a threshold, the old heading is rotated by the maximum amount in the given direction and scaled by the magnitude of the acceleration.
Therefore boids have a maximum value in which they can turn at each step of the simulation.

\subsection*{Escape maneuvers}

The 2 simplest escape maneuvers are implemented: escape based on position and based on velocity (direction) of the predator.

The position based escape maneuver works exactly the same way as separation, except the position of predator is taken into account.

The direction based escape maneuver works such that it determines on which side of prey lies the predator, and going into a perpendicular direction in the opposite side.

\subsection*{Predators}

2 simple predator behaviors (strategies) are implemented: attack centroid, attack random prey.

\section*{Results}

By combining all the features adding upon realism and the escape maneuvers, we can obtain a realstic patter \textbf{split}.
This pattern is obtain by using the \textbf{position} based escape manuever and any predator tactic.

\section*{Discussion}

This concludes boids implementation with additional realsitic features.
The simulation itself was heavily parameterized aswell, making tweakings easiser and more reproducible.

There is still room for improvement in the visualization of the simulation (add traces, add predators target, ...).

The most important aspect which remains is the implementation of different escape manuevers and predator tactics and the comparisons of the latter.
