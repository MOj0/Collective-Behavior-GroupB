\begin{abstract}
The collective behaviours observed in nature, such as flocking, herding, or schooling, often serve as adaptive strategies that enhance the survival chances of individuals within a group.
Understanding these natural behaviors serves as inspiration for designing autonomous agents capable of sophisticated interactions within a simulated environment.
Our goal is to simulate prey and predator with different predator tactics (attack center, attack nearest, attack isolated, attacks from various directions, constant bearing hunting), escape maneuvers (split, hourglass, herd, vacuole, flash expansion, fountain) and parameters (perception radius, moving speed, turning speed) in order to conclude how different escape maneuvers affect predator's success.

This research paper however, will only focus on the basic boid (bird-oid object) simulation.
This simulation will serve as a foundation for the more complex simulations in the future.

\section*{Introduction}

% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.
\dropcap{O}ne of the most striking patterns in biology is the formation of animal aggregations.
Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources \cite{complexity_pattern}.
We will presume the most common hypotheses, which is that flocking evolved in order to provide defense against predators, and conclude with which flocking behaviour is the most effective for prey and predator.
Our research is based on Emergence of splits and collective turns in pigeon flocks under predation \cite{papadopoulou2022emergence}, which we will extend by providing concrete results in the predator and prey simulation.
This research is similar to Jure Demšar and Iztok Lebar Bajec's Comparison of (predator) tactics \cite{JDemsar_predator_attacks}.
The main difference between the mentioned research and ours is the use of boids algorithm instead of fuzzy logic.

The flocking behaviour can be simulated in different ways.
For example Heppner and Grenader \cite{Heppner_nonlinear_model} were modeling bird's behaviour with stohastic nonlinear differential equations.
Oweis, Ganesan and Cheok \cite{centralized_flocking} took a different approach and modeled birds with a centralized logic (as in the server-client architecture).
In 1987, Reynolds \cite{reynolds1987flocks} proposed a simple algorithm, which was groundbreaking at the time, to model the
flocking behavior of birds, herding of sheep, and similar phenomena, known as the Boids (Bird-oid objects) model.
In contrast to controlling the interactions of the entire flock, the Boids simulation focuses on
dictating the behavior of each individual boid. Despite consisting of a few simple rules, this
algorithm produces complex and lifelike behaviors similar to those observed in nature.

Our paper centers on the implementation of a predator-prey behavior utilizing a Boids simulation.

\section*{Methods}
As a starting point, a basic boids model has been implemented, which is based on
three simple rules:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Avoid collisions.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Basic boids implementation}

Each boid $B$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item position - a vector in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $, denoted by $position(B)$,
	\item velocity - a vector in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $, denoted by $velocity(B)$,
	\item acceleration - a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$; used exclusively
	      for the internal \\ computation of the boid's velocity and not for behavioral logic.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent With regards to behavioral logic, we also assign the following
attributes to all boids:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item perception radius of 300 degrees (denoted by $r_P$)
	\item separation radius (denoted by $r_S$, also note that $ r_S < r_P $)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The {\em Euclidean distance} (\ref{eq:eucl_dst}) is used for computing the distance between boids.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eucl_dst}
	d(p, q) = \sqrt{(p_1-q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2};\  p, q \in \mathbb{R}^2
\end{equation}
To avoid the computation of the costly square root of a real number, we utilize an equivalent formula
(\ref{eq:eucl_dst_sq}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eucl_dst_sq}
	d(p, q)^2 = (p_1-q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2;\  p, q \in \mathbb{R}^2
\end{equation}

Each step of the simulation loop updates the direction of a boid, which is then applied to its acceleration,
determining the actual velocity for all boids.

The direction for collision avoidance, also known as {\em separation}, for boid $B$ is computed by the
following formula (\ref{eq:sum_dir_vectors}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sum_dir_vectors}
	direction = \sum_{i=1}^{n} position(B) - position(B_i)
\end{equation}
where $i$-th boid $B_i$ is a boid such that: $ d(position(B), position(B_i))^2 < r_S^2 $.
This effectively means that boid $B$ will move away (in the opposite direction) from the boids which are too near (closer than the specified $r_S$).

The direction for {\em alignment} for boid $B$ is computed as (\ref{eq:sum_align}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sum_align}
	direction = \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} velocity(B_i)}{n} - velocity(B) \right) \mathbin{/} 8
\end{equation}
where $i$-th boid $B_i$ is a boid such that: $ d(position(B), position(B_i)^2 < r_P^2) $ (i.e., $B_i$ is $B$'s neighbour).
First, the average velocity of all neighboring boids is computed (denoted $v_{avg}$).
The velocity of current boid $B$ is then subtracted from $v_{avg}$, such that a vector in the direction
from $velocity(B)$ to $v_{avg}$ is obtained.
Adding such a vector to the $velocity(B)$ would result in $velocity(B)$ being equal to the $v_{avg}$.
Since this result is not desired, direction is lastly divided by a constant $8$.

The direction for {\em cohesion} for boid $B$ is computed like so (\ref{eq:sum_coh}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sum_coh}
	direction = \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(position(B_i) - position(B)\right)}{n} \right) \mathbin{/} 100
\end{equation}
where $i$-th boid $B_i$ is a boid such that: $ d(position(B), position(B_i)^2 < r_P^2) $ (i.e., $B_i$ is $B$'s neighbour).
In this formula a centroid to the neighboring boids is computed, which is then divided by $100$.
The reasoning behind the constant $100$ is that on every update, each boid would move $1\%$ towards the centroid.
\bigskip

The occlusion algorithm aims to determine whether a potential neighbor (other prey) is obstructed or hidden from the view of a 
focal prey based on the angle between their relative positions. Occlusion is assessed by comparing the angle between the velocity 
vector of the focal prey and the vector pointing to the potential neighbor. If this angle falls within a specified occlusion threshold
and the distance to the potential neighbor exceeds a certain threshold, then the neighbor is considered occluded. 
This mechanism enhances the realism of the preys perception, a phenomenon observed in biological systems 
where obstacles or other agents may temporarily obscure the line of sight between individuals within a group.

		\draw[fill=blue!20, draw=blue!80] (0,0) circle (2);
		
		% Define a triangle shape for the top boid
		\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,green] (boid1) at (0,1.5) {};
		
		% Define a triangle shape for the middle boid
		\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (boid2) at (0,0) {};
		
		% Define a triangle shape for the bottom boid
		\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,red] (boid3) at (0,-1.5) {};
		
		% Draw arrows indicating occlusion
		\draw[green,thick,<-] (boid2) -- (boid1);
		\draw[blue,thick,->] (boid2) -- (boid3);
		
		% Label for occlusion
		\node[blue, below] at (0, -0.5) {Occlusion};
	\end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

The collision mechanism embedded within the boids encapsulates essential features for simulating interactions among agents. These features include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Proximity evaluation:}
	The mechanism begins with a calculation of the squared distance between the focal boid and its neighboring agents. 
	This evaluation forms the foundation for assessing proximity in the simulated environment.
	\item \textbf{Angular separation:}
	To refine the proximity assessment, the mechanism considers the angular separation between the velocities of the focal boid and its neighbors. 
	This angular comparison contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial relationships between agents.
	\item \textbf{Visibility determination:} 
	Usage of the occlusion algorithm.
	\item \textbf{Dynamic response:}
	The collision mechanism plays a crucial role in influencing the boid's behavior by dynamically adjusting its desired acceleration in response to the presence of neighboring agents. 
	This ensures that the boid navigates the environment in a responsive and realistic manner.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Basic predator implementation}

The basic predator implementation provides a foundation for simulating predator behavior in a multi-agent system.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Perception and interaction:}
	Predators exhibit a limited perception range and field of view, as determined by the perception radius and angle of view parameters. 
	This constrains their ability to detect and interact with potential prey within a specified region.
	\item \textbf{Occlusion handling:}
	The behavior incorporates an occlusion mechanism that considers the angle between the predator and potential prey, as well as the distance between them. 
	This feature accounts for scenarios where prey may be temporarily obstructed by other prey, adding realism to predator-prey interactions.
	\item \textbf{Centroid-based movement:}
	Predators dynamically adjust their movement based on the calculated centroid of detected prey. 
	This strategy influences the predators directional movement, guiding it toward the central position of its perceived prey.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Results}
We have successfully implemented the model described in the previous section.
Correct behaviour was confirmed with the help of special debug draw commands on top of the boids.
We present 4 screenshots of the simulation at steps $0, 50$, $100$ and at $100$ with a 300 degree field of view.
We can see that at first boids are in random positions, but as the simulation progresses, they start forming groups (\textbf{cohesion}) which generally go in the same direction (\textbf{alignment}).
Eventually, a single group is formed.

In an insightful refinement of the model, the field of view of the boids has been adjusted from 360 degrees to 300 degrees. 
This modification has a notable impact on the simulation outcomes [\ref{300deg}]. If we inspect the 100th step, the boids exhibit a considerably more dispersed distribution. 
The reduced field of view introduces a nuanced layer to the boid interactions, leading to a broader spatial distribution and decreased cohesion among the agents.
The enhancement of the boids flocking simulation is marked by significant refinements. 
The improvements encompass a heightened sensitivity to the boids rotational dynamics, allowing for a more nuanced simulation of their rotational speeds. 
Furthermore, the introduction of systematic parameterization enhances the models flexibility and adaptability. 
Additionally, a novel escape model has been integrated, introducing a simple yet effective mechanism for boids to navigate away from potential threats. 
The implementation now also accounts for occlusion among boids, providing a more realistic representation of their interactions in complex environments.
