\significancestatement{Procedural generation of a tropic island and \\coral reef}{In computer graphics there is frequent need for displaying large vistas of natural looking terrain. Designing such terrain by hand is typically time consuming. With procedural generation, on the other hand, larger areas of natural looking terrain can be generated with or without minimal intervention in a relatively short time. In this work we present a process of procedural generation of a tropical island with the associated corral reef. We start by generating a heightmap for the base terrain. The heightmap is then transformed by simulating the processes of hydraulic and thermal erosion to achieve a more natural look of the terrain. As coral reefs often grow around tropical islands, we also simulate their growth as part of the last step. Real-time visualization is enabled during the simulation, so that one can observe the evolution of the terrain. Here we dynamically apply textures to the terrain based on its local characteristics. The result is a natural looking model of the textured tropical island and corral reef.}{Procedural generation | Terrain generation | Thermal and hydraulic erosion | Coral reef | Simulation | GPU}

\section*{Introduction}

% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.
\dropcap{I}n 1987, Reynolds \cite{reynolds1987flocks} proposed a simple algorithm to model the
flocking behavior of birds, herding of sheep, and similar phenomena, known as the Boids (Bird-oid objects) model.
Instead of controlling the interactions of the flock as a whole, the Boids simulation only specifies the behavior of each individual boid (much like how it works in nature).
Even though the algorithm is comprised of only a few simple rules, it generates a complex and realistic behaviour, similar to those found in nature.

\noindent Every boid abides by three simple rules:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Avoid collisions.
	      \begin{center}
		      \begin{tikzpicture}
			      % Draw a semi-transparent blue circle with a dark border
			      \draw[fill=blue!20, draw=blue!80] (0,0) circle (2);
			      % Define a triangle shape
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,green] (t1) at (0,0) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (t2) at (.5, 1) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (t3) at (-.75, .5) {};
			      % Outside,rotated
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, draw, rotate=30] (rotated) at (2.5,0) {};

			      \draw[green,thick] (t1) -- (t2);
			      \draw[green,thick] (t1) -- (t3);

			      \draw[red,thick,->] (t1) -- (-.125,-.75);
		      \end{tikzpicture}
	      \end{center}
	\item Maintain the same heading and speed as the neighboring boids.
	      \begin{center}
		      \begin{tikzpicture}
			      % Draw a semi-transparent blue circle with a dark border
			      \draw[fill=blue!20, draw=blue!80] (0,0) circle (2);
			      % Define a triangle shape
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,green,rotate=-30] (t1) at (0,0) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue,rotate=-30] (t2) at (-1.5, 0) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue,rotate=-30] (t3) at (1.5, 0) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue,rotate=-30] (t4) at (0, -1.5) {};

			      \draw[green,thick,->] (t1) -- ++(.5, 1);
			      \draw[black,thick,->] (t2) -- ++(.5, 1);
			      \draw[black,thick,->] (t3) -- ++(.5, 1);
			      \draw[black,thick,->] (t4) -- ++(.5, 1);
		      \end{tikzpicture}
	      \end{center}
	\item Gravitate toward the center of the flock.
	      \begin{center}
		      \begin{tikzpicture}
			      % Draw a semi-transparent blue circle with a dark border
			      \draw[fill=blue!20, draw=blue!80] (0,0) circle (2);
			      % Define a triangle shape
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (t1) at (0,0) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (t2) at (.5, 1) {};
			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,blue] (t3) at (-.75, .5) {};

			      \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=.5cm, fill,green] (t4) at (1.2, -1.1) {};

			      \draw[green, thick] (t1) -- (-.125,.75);
			      \fill[green, thick] (-.125,.75) circle (2pt);
			      \draw[green,thick] (t2) -- (t3);

			      \draw[red,thick,->] (t4) -- (.75,-.3);
		      \end{tikzpicture}
	      \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

We will present how we implemented such Boid simulation, with an additional step which will make simulating different Boids (prey, predator) easier.
% TODO: We should also include logic for predator (if we implement it for this milestone)
